## desktop-control adapter for ioBroker

Controls Windows PCs from ioBroker: popups, programs, audio, text-to-speech, screenshots, power, keyboard/mouse and more. On each PC runs the small **WinCtl** agent (a single exe, no installer); adapter and agent talk via **MQTT**.

The agent describes itself: it publishes all its commands, parameters and states as a manifest, and the adapter creates the data points from it. New agent commands therefore appear without an adapter update.

## Requirements

- The WinCtl agent on every PC to control: download `WinCtl.exe` from [the releases](https://github.com/ipod86/WinCtl/releases)
- Nothing else: the adapter has a built-in MQTT broker. An existing broker (Mosquitto, ioBroker MQTT adapter) can be used instead.

## Setup

1. Adapter settings: keep "Built-in broker" (port 1886 by default). Optionally set a user name and password – the agents then have to use them.
2. Start `WinCtl.exe` on the PC. In its settings enter the **IP address of the ioBroker server**, the port (1886) and the login.
3. Each PC appears as a device as soon as it connects.

### Broker: built-in or existing

Adapter and agents exchange everything through an MQTT broker. Two options:

| | Built-in broker (default) | Existing broker |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | `WinCtl.exe` → **adapter** (port 1886) | `WinCtl.exe` → broker ← adapter |
| Adapter setting | "Built-in broker", port, optional user/password | "Existing broker" + address, port and login of the broker |
| In the agent | IP of the ioBroker server, port 1886, login from the adapter | address, port and login of the broker |
| Good for | most installations – nothing else to install | Mosquitto or the ioBroker MQTT adapter already runs, ACLs/TLS wanted, or other programs should read along |

The built-in broker uses port 1886 on purpose, not 1883, so it does not clash with an existing broker or the MQTT adapter.

## Data points

### Overview

| Data point | Description |
|---|---|
| `info.connection` | Adapter connected to the MQTT broker |
| `<pc>.online` | Agent of this PC connected |
| `<pc>.lastSeen` | Time of the last message from the agent |
| `<pc>.info.*` | Information about the PC (see below) |
| `<pc>.state.*` | Values reported by the agent (see [States](#states-pcstate)) |
| `<pc>.event.*` | Events of the PC (see below) |
| `<pc>.cmd.*` | One data point per command (see [Commands](#commands-pccmd)) |
| `<pc>.cmd.result` | Result of the last command, e.g. the answer of `ask` |
| `<pc>.screenshot` | Path of the last screenshot in the ioBroker file storage, e.g. `/desktop-control.0/screenshots/<pc>.jpg` |
| `<pc>.cmd.wake` | Switches the PC on via Wake-on-LAN – handled by the adapter, so it works while the PC is off |
| `all.cmd.*` | Sends a command to all PCs at once (`all.cmd.wake` wakes all PCs that are off) |

### Info (`<pc>.info.*`)

| Data point | Description |
|---|---|
| `hostname` | Computer name |
| `ip` | IP address |
| `version` | Version of the agent |
| `os` | Windows version |
| `user` | Logged-in user |
| `started` | Start time of the agent |
| `mac` | MAC address of the network card (for Wake-on-LAN) |
| `apps` | Program aliases the agent may start (JSON list) |

### Events (`<pc>.event.*`)

Written on every event (also when the content is the same), so a trigger with `change: 'any'` fires every time. The value is JSON, e.g. `{"ts":"2026-10-23T12:00:00Z"}`.

| Data point | When |
|---|---|
| `lock` / `unlock` | Screen locked / unlocked |
| `logon` / `logoff` | User logged on / off |
| `remote_connect` / `remote_disconnect` | Remote desktop session connected / disconnected |
| `suspend` / `resume` | PC goes to standby / wakes up |
| `hotkey` | A hotkey from the agent settings was pressed: `{"name":"szene_kino","keys":"ctrl+alt+1"}` |

### Commands (`<pc>.cmd.*`)

- **Button:** commands without options – click to run.
- **Button + `_json` input:** commands whose options are all optional (e.g. `screenshot`, `mute`, `beep`): the button runs with the defaults, `cmd.<command>_json` takes the options.
- **Input:** commands with a required option. Write one of:
  - the **short form**: just the value of the main option, e.g. `Hello` into `cmd.speak`
  - **JSON** with any options, e.g. `{"text":"Hello","rate":2}`
  - `true` – runs the command with its default options
- The object description of every command data point lists its options and an example.
- The result appears in `<pc>.cmd.result`.
- Security relevant commands (e.g. `shell`) and commands switched off in the agent get no data point; they can only be sent via `sendTo`. `run` and `kill` get a data point as long as the agent only starts programs from its alias list ("allow any program" off); `cmd.run` offers the aliases as a selection.

## Scripts (sendTo)

```js
// command to one PC (device id or host name), the answer is the result of the agent
sendTo('desktop-control.0', 'cmd', { device: 'office-pc', command: 'speak', params: { text: 'Dinner is ready' } }, res => log(JSON.stringify(res)));

// short form for the main parameter
sendTo('desktop-control.0', 'cmd', { device: 'office-pc', command: 'volume', params: 30 });

// question with buttons, waits for the answer (ask timeout from the settings)
sendTo('desktop-control.0', 'cmd', {
    device: 'living-room',
    command: 'ask',
    params: { text: 'Start movie mode?', buttons: ['Yes', 'No'], timeout: 30 },
}, res => log(res.result && res.result.button));

// all PCs, list of devices
sendTo('desktop-control.0', 'cmd', { device: 'all', command: 'lock' });
sendTo('desktop-control.0', 'devices', {}, list => log(JSON.stringify(list)));
```

The answer has the form `{ ok, command, result, error }`.

## Wake-on-LAN

The agent reports the MAC address of its network card; the adapter keeps it, so `cmd.wake` also works after a restart while the PC is off. Requirements: Wake-on-LAN enabled in the BIOS/UEFI and in the network card settings (Device Manager → network card → Power Management / Advanced), PC connected by cable, ioBroker in the same network. Windows "Fast startup" can prevent waking from shutdown – switch it off if needed.

## Updating the agent

The agent checks GitHub for a new version at start and every 12 hours (can be switched off in the agent settings, first tab after the connection). It **does not install by itself**, it only reports:

- `<pc>.state.update_available` – `true` when a newer version exists
- `<pc>.state.latest_version` – newest version on GitHub; the installed one is in `<pc>.info.version`

Installing:

- **from ioBroker:** button `<pc>.cmd.update` – downloads the new exe, checks the checksum, swaps it and restarts the agent. After a few seconds the PC is online again with the new version in `info.version`.
- **on the PC:** tray icon → menu entry to check for updates – shows the changes and asks whether to install.
- `<pc>.cmd.check_update` checks right away without installing.

Automatically with a script:

```js
on({ id: /^desktop-control\.0\.[^.]+\.state\.update_available$/, val: true }, obj => {
    setState(obj.id.replace('state.update_available', 'cmd.update'), true);
});
```

Requirement: the exe is in a folder the user can write to (e.g. `C:\Tools\WinCtl` or Downloads, not `C:\Program Files`).

## Security

Whoever may write to `winctl/+/cmd/#` controls the PC. Secure the broker with user/password and ACLs, use TLS if needed. By default the agent only starts programs from its alias list and `shell` is off.
